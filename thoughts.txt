As part of assignment I have decided to create a timeline plots for the news articles.


Beginning with the assignment, I have converted the json file into dataframe. After converting the file into dataframe I have
conducted basic data preprocessing like cleaning the NAN values present in the date feature. Removing duplicates to ensure we have 
unique title and dates.
The dates columns needed some cleaning . I have extracted only the datetime part to ensure that the columns has only date of the event happening.
After preprocessing, I have used sentence transformer to convert the title into word embeddings. 
For model training, we created batches of data to ensure the fast and efficient model training.
Finally I have used dbscan to cluster the documents together which possess some similarity. I have used dbscan because of its spatial 
nature. The embeddings for sentence with similar meanings will be closed to each other .
After implementing dbscan we selected relevant articles for the date, where embeddings are closer to the cluster centers.
Exporting this data into dataframe, timeline chart was plotted using plotly graph objects.
